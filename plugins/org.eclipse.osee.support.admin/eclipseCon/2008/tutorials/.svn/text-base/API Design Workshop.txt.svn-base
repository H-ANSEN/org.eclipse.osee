Read through the presentation slides at http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/?page=sub/&id=65
very good slides (look at the slides on listeners)

if you care about compatibility, do not have subclasses extend interfaces rather use abstract classes
this means extension points should require abstract classes and not interfaces
