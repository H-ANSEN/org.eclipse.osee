Name:  Going Vertical: An Experience from the Aerospace Industry

Abstract:

If you are interested in collaborating on the current effort to apply the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/osee">Open System Engineering Environment</a> (OSEE) to Aerospace and Automotive industries or in learning how OSEE might be applied to your industry, then this talk is for you.  

Industries that build complex, mission-critical systems typically work with many suppliers in order to create a single integrated product.  These products often have long development lifecycles and have stringent requirements for verification, traceability, and document deliverables.  In order to effectively manage this complexity, these industries are required to assemble a wide array of tools that provide only piecemeal capabilities.  Often, the resulting toolset provides disconnected access to partially redundant data and may carry with it multi-million dollar software licensing, customization, and maintenance costs.

OSEE is being developed to provide an integrated solution to these challenges.  At the heart of OSEE is an Application Framework which provides a powerful persistence layer allowing applications to utilize a common data model that is accessible to all OSEE applications.  Two such applications, that are widely applicable, have already been created: a powerful requirements and document management solution, OSEE Define, and a full featured change management system, OSEE ATS. 

The OSEE Eclipse project provides tremendous opportunities to collaborate on industry wide solutions and build upon lessons already learned.

A significant source of waste when developing complex systems is handing off work between separate functional disciplines and the associated knowledge loss. Someone who knows this first hand is Jonathan Ive, head of design at Apple, who stated that "The historical way of developing products just doesn't work when you're as ambitious as we are. When the challenges are that complex, you have to develop a product in a more collaborative, integrated way." Engineering a product in a more collaborative and integrated way requires an engineering environment that is itself tightly integrated.


A solution that is developed by all the players in the vertical enables each competitor to become more attractive in the corresponding market.  A smaller cost of collaboration in an open source solution yields a long term gain for all involved.  This is in contrary to the proprietary competitors whose main focus is on hording the specific functionality that all need to succeed.  As Mike Mil?? stated, "We've come up with a way to help multiple companies - including direct competitors - to work together on a level playing field to build next-generation platforms and then compete with the applications they build on top of this platform. In other words, they use Eclipse to collaborate on a platform and then compete on the products that run on the platform."

Recently submitted and approved as an Eclipse project, The Open System Engineering Environment (OSEE) is designed to maintain the extensibility of the Eclipse platform and give the added benefit of sharing data between the applications built upon.

Intended audience:  Engineers in industry verticals that are looking for a platform to provide their solution.  We hope to let these people see that OSEE can be that platform.

Ideas:
   - OSEE scales from simple application development to complex mission-critical software and systems engineering
   - delivery of tool and DB, not documents
   - get US Government on board and everyone's using OSEE
   - collaboration can provide for easier plug-in-play software between companies; eg: Rockwell could sell their ARC-210 radio requirements, code, test to Boeing
   - collaboration between competitors happens anyway, why not make it direct
   - indirect collaboration happens when a company provides a solution to requirements Mgmt, they then sell to Boeing who asks for enhancements and customization, company makes improvements which they then sell to the next customer

Industry Vertical presentations:
The industry vertical track is looking for short talks and panel submissions related to the use of Eclipse technology within specific industry verticals such as Automotive, Healthcare or Finance. Topics can be either of a technical or business nature and could cover emerging domain specific platforms or other solutions for the vertical.

Eclipse and Industry Verticals: The healthcare experience:
Within Eclipse there is growing interest in vertical industry projects. Currently the only full vertical industry Eclipse project is the Open Healthcare Framework (OHF), which intends to provide extensible frameworks, tools and run-time components based on a coherent secure Eclipse based architecture. OHF - and other industry verticals - a somewhat different from other eclipse projects. This presentation will review the history and current status of the OHF project. OHF's various deliverables and interests will be reviewed, and the relationship between OHF and the general Eclipse community and roadmap will be considered. In addition, the presentation will consider the requirements for a successful industry vertical, including the kind of relationships that are needed in the industry, and the relationships that will be needed within eclipse when more than one vertical industry project exists.

Building the next generation weather platform in Eclipse
In 2005, NOAA contracted Raytheon to develop the National Weather Service's next generation platform for Advanced Weather Information Processing System (AWIPS). AWIPS is currently deployed at 122 forecast offices nation-wide, in addition to many national labs and centers. It is the primary tool for National Weather Service forecasters. Instead of the typical contractor closed-source and proprietary approach, we are developing the system using completely open-source and free technologies. At the foundation of the weather workstation is the Eclipse Rich Client Platform, which will allow far more flexibility and extendability than the existing UNIX-platform dependent system.

The CAVE (Common AWIPS Visualization Environment) will bring together a variety of disparate user interfaces into a common environment. A technology demo of the system will be given showing:

    * CAVE's OpenGL-based rendering system
    * Core capabilities such as GIS visualization, collaboration and editing
    * A quick look at the Eclipse extension points developed to build the platform 

Prerequisites: A general understanding of Eclipse RCP
