Improved Engineering Through Integrated Workflows and Data Management

Abstract:

Engineering complex systems requires the continuous process of creating, decomposing, changing, relating and accessing data.  From the highest customer requirements to the customer deliverables, the storage and management of engineering lifecycle data can be the key to success or a single point of failure.  In addition, efficiently capturing, storing and retrieving this information by anyone at anytime can mean the difference between the need for a small agile staff or an army of engineers.  And last, the ability to easily and clearly integrate your processes and workflows through the tools will result in decreased need for maintenance and training of complex processes.

The Open System Engineering Environment (OSEE) project provides solutions to these issues by integrating the Action Tracking System (ATS) into its integrated data and user interface engineering lifecycle tool.  This high powered change tracking system can manage any number of teams (designers, coder, qualification engineers, IT and facilities) with their workflows (ranging from simple to complex) and relate them to the requirements, design, code, test and deliverables that are stored and change managed within, or external, to OSEE.  ATS also provides integrated project tracking and simplified metrics rollup to allow metrics to be calculated at anytime on any subset of change requests.

This talk will describe how this approach has helped the development of the Open System Engineering Environment itself and the avionics software for the Boeing Longbow Apache AH-64 Attack Helicopter and how the use of these principles can greatly improve any lifecycle engineering toolset.

Data Management

The official definition provided by DAMA is that "Data Resource Management is the development and execution of architectures, policies, practices and procedures that properly manage the full data lifecycle needs of an enterprise." This definition is fairly broad and encompasses a number of professions which may not have direct technical contact with lower-level aspects of data management, such as relational database management.

Software Engineering

Software engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.[1] It encompasses techniques and procedures, often regulated by a software development process, with the purpose of improving the reliability and maintainability of software systems.[2] The effort is necessitated by the potential complexity of those systems, which may contain millions of lines of code.[3]

Workflow

A workflow is a depiction of a sequence of operations, declared as work of a person, work of a simple or complex mechanism, work of a group of persons,[1] work of an organization of staff, or machines. Workflow may be seen as any abstraction of real work, segregated in workshare, work split or whatever types of ordering. For control purposes, workflow may be a view on real work under a chosen aspect,[2] thus serving as a virtual representation of actual work.

A workflow is a model to represent real work for further assessment, e.g., for describing a reliably repeatable sequence of operations. More abstractly, a workflow is a pattern of activity enabled by a systematic organization of resources, defined roles and mass, energy and information flows, into a work process that can be documented and learned.[3][4] Workflows are designed to achieve processing intents of some sort, such as physical transformation, service provision, or information processing.

Workflow concepts are closely related to other concepts used to describe organizational structure, such as silos, functions, teams, projects, policies and hierarchies. Workflows may be viewed as one primitive building block of organizations. The relationships among these concepts are described later in this entry.

The term workflow is used in computer programming to capture and develop human to machine interaction. Workflow software aims to provide end users with an easier way to orchestrate or describe complex processing of data in a visual form, much like flow charts but without the need to understand computers or programming.
