To Be Done:
- workbench lockup issue
- create screencast of User Use Case Scenario
- create why use ATS slide
- create configuration of ATS for Demo
- test workflow creation wizard
   - should relate if workflow already exists
   - not putting pages and flows in default hierarchy
   - should create if workflow doesn't exist

---------------------------------------------------------
-- ATS User Use Case Scenario
---------------------------------------------------------

Why move all action, issue, problem tracking to ATS?
-	Everyone has access to all data
-	As issue/problem is analyzed, other teams can be added to Action
-	Each team has it’s own independent workflow
-	Workflows can be simple or complex
-	One interface = Low cost of setup, deployment, training and admin

T. Rex decides to move to ATS - whew, that was tough ;>)

Show configuration of ATS for T. Rex - TBD  
   - Teams and Actionable Items
   - Workflows
   - Branch diagram
   - Show diagram of what is being demo'd below
      - Coder to Req to Coder to Test to Tools and Documentation and Facilities
   - Show Action w/ workflows, reviews, tasks

Notes: You're welcome to follow along and perform the steps
   - Limited time, so need to keep moving
   - Will just explain some of the things going on versus showing due to time
   - Will operate as more than one user, but will always say Joe Smith
   - Will operate on single computer, this is multi-user/computer system with notifications

Use Case: Problem w/ requirement impacts code, test, tool and facilities
