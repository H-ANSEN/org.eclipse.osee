Git: Taking the leap
20 min
Roberto, Ryan

With features such as inexpensive branching, offline repository history access, interactive rebasing, 
efficient merging and change stashing, Git prevails over other revision control systems as developers 
are forced to context switch between code changes. As committers for the Eclipse Open System Engineering 
Environment project, we recently completed our migration from Subversion to Git. During this talk you will 
hear about our experience as well as additional migration we have done across our organization. 

•	Subversion, CVS, Source Safe, RCS 
•	What are the benefits of using Git?
•	How do you get buy-in from developers?
•	Porting issues?
•	Migration tools are available to port different version control systems?
•	Convincing management to take the leap
