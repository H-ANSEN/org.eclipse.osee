Git: Taking the leap
20 min
Roberto, Ryan

With features such as fast and convenient branching, offline access to entire repository history, interactive rebasing, 
efficient merging and change stashing, Git prevails over other revision control systems as developers 
are forced to context switch between code changes. As committers for the Eclipse Open System Engineering 
Environment project, we recently completed our migration from Subversion to Git. During this talk you will 
hear about our experience as well as additional migrations we have done across our organization involving several hundred thousand lines of code. 

Specifically, we will cover
•	What are the benefits of using Git
•	migration from Subversion, CVS, Source Safe, and RCS 
•	Porting issues
•	How do you get buy-in from developers?
•	Convincing management to take the leap
