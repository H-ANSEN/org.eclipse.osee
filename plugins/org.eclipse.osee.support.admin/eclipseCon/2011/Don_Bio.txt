Don Dunne has over 18 years experience in embedded and application software development.  The last 10 years have been spent working in the Boeing Longbow Apache Attack Helicopter software engineering group performing numerous roles including flight software development, qualification and tool development.  The past 5 years have been spent developing and deploying the Open System Engineering Environment (OSEE - http://www.eclipse.org/osee) which is an open source development environment to develop, capture and relate information througout the lifecycle of software engineering.  This requirements management, configuration management and qualification environment is being used on the USG Block III and Taiwan Longbow Apache program and most recently selected as the primary tool in the software development for the AH-6 program. 


Don Dunne is the co-lead and committer of the Open System Engineering Environment (OSEE) project and has spent the past 7 years architecting, developing and deploying eclipse plugins in its support. He is also a committer on the Nebula project in support of the XViewer, an extension to the JFace TreeViewer.  He graduated with a BS in Computer Science at University of Central Florida. He has over 17 years experience in Embedded Software Engineering with a focus on the development and deployment of tools to streamline the software engineering lifecycle. The past 5 years have included the development of the Action Tracking System (ATS) which is a tightly integrated change management tool built on the OSEE Application Framework. ATS enables tracking of all tasks throughout the lifecycle of development including hardware, software, tools, process and facilities with the ability to graphically configure different workflows for each.  He is currently focused on gaining support for the continued and expanding collaboration of OSEE throughout the commercial, academic and defense sectors.
