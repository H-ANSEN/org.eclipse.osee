   <h1>Create new workflow configuration</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		To create a new workflow configuration that ATS uses to move an Action through it's specific workflow.
		This is done using four different artifact types.
      <ul>
         <li><a href="create_workflowdefinition_artifact.html">Work Flow Definition<a> specifies
         the states, their transitions and the state that represents the beginning of the 
         workflow.</li>
         <li><a href="create_workpagedefinition_artifact.html">Work Page Definition<a> defines
         the a single state of the Work Flow Definition.</li>
         <li><a href="create_workwidgetdefinition_artifact.html">Work Widget Definition<a> defines
         a single field and its corresponding attribute that the value will be stored in.  It 
         also provides some layout capabilities for that widget.</li>
         <li><a href="create_workruledefinition_artifact.html">Work Rule Definition<a> defines
         certain rules that can be applied to Work Pages and Team Definitions.</li>
      </ul>
		<h2>How to do it</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Workflows can be created using the workflow configuration editor (0.6.0 release).  Using 
         New -> Other -> OSEE ATS -> Workflow Configuraiton will generate a simple starting
         point for a new workflow.  States and their transitions can be edited through this
         interface.  Other modifications will need to be edited through 
         <a href="create_workflowdefinition_artifact.html">Work Flow Definition<a> attributes
         and relations.</li>
         <li>Work Pages, Widgets and Rules are currently edited through the
         attributes and relations using the default Artifact Editor.  See links above to
         set the proper values.</li>
         <li>Configurations can also be created through the java.  An example of this can
         be seen by looking at the org.eclipse.osee.ats.config.demo plugin. This plugin, and the
         DemoDatabaseConfig.java class, shows how to programatically generate work flows, pages,
         rules and widgets to configure ATS.  This configuration will be generated during a database
         initialization.</li>
      </ul>
