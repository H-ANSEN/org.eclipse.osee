OSEE's use of Zest requires org.eclipse.mylyn.zest.core and org.ecliplse.mylyn.zest.layouts projects.
These projects are currently being moved from the mylyn sandbox area to the GEF project.  Until this
move is complete, and GEF is released with Zest, these plugins are provided as part of the OSEE project.
