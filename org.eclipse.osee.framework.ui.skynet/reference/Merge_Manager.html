<h1>Merge Manager View</h1>
<img border="0" src="Merge_1.jpg"><br>
&nbsp;<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Merge Manager is used to resolve conflicts that arise when doing 
development on parallel branches.&nbsp; The Merge Manager makes conflicts that 
arise easily identifiable and then provides the means for resolving the 
conflicts, so that the working branch can be committed.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Merge Manager is in place to find conflicts and help users resolve these 
conflicts.&nbsp; A conflict exists if the value of an attribute/artifact has 
changed on both the Destination and Source Branches.&nbsp; For reference the 
Source Branch is the users working branch.&nbsp; It is the branch that the user 
has been making changes to and would like to then add back into the Destination 
Branch or Baseline Branch.&nbsp; Both branches are identified by name in the 
header of the Merge Manager.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Depending upon the conflict found, the user may have several choices for 
resolution.&nbsp; These include </p>
<ul>
	<li>Accept the value on the Source Branch and overwrite the value on the 
	Destination Branch</li>
	<li>Accept the value on the Destination Branch and do not add any of the 
	Source Branch changes, (These will still show up as merged on
	<a href="change_table.html">Change Reports</a>)</li>
	<li>Create a solution that is a combination of the two changes </li>
	<li>Revert the changes on the Source Branch&nbsp; (This is the only 
	available solution when the Artifact/Attribute was deleted on the 
	Destination Branch, will show up as no change on the
	<a href="change_table.html">Change Report</a>)</li>
	<li>Do nothing (only possible for informational conflicts)</li>
</ul>
<p>Committing of Branches is blocked until all conflicts are resolved.</p>
<h2>The GUI</h2>
<p>The GUI is organized to provide the user with an ability to quickly identify 
conflicts.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The Heading</b> - The Heading contains text to help identify what is 
	being merged. It identifies the Source Branch, and the Destination Branch.&nbsp; 
	It also provides the user with information about how many conflicts there 
	are and if they have been resolved.&nbsp; The Heading also contains easy 
	launch icons for additional tools in connection with the Merge Manager.</li>
	<li><b>The Conflict Resolution Column</b> - This column provides the user 
	information about the state of the conflict.&nbsp; A blank entry in the 
	column means that the conflict is new and has not had any actions performed 
	on it. A
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/chkbox_disabled.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	indicates that conflict is in the modified state.&nbsp; This means the user 
	has begun merging the conflict but has not marked it as resolved.&nbsp; The 
	user may transition it into the resolved state by left clicking on the
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/chkbox_disabled.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon. The
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/accept.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon indicates the the user has marked the conflict as resolved.&nbsp; This 
	means they have selected a value for it and have verified the value going in 
	is what they want.&nbsp; No additional changes are allowed on a conflict 
	once it is in the resolved state.&nbsp; It can be placed back into the 
	modified state by left clicking on the
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/accept.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon. The
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/chkbox_enabled_conflicted.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	means that a conflict was in the resolved state but a new change has 
	occurred on either the Source or Destination Branch.&nbsp; It serves to 
	notify the user that the conflict was not in the finalized state when they 
	resolved the conflict.&nbsp; The user can return to resolved state by left 
	clicking on the&nbsp;
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/chkbox_enabled_conflicted.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon.&nbsp; The
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/red_light.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon indicates that an Artifact or Attribute must be reverted on the Source 
	Branch.&nbsp; This indicates that the Artifact/Attribute was deleted on the 
	Destination Branch and can not have a change committed onto it.&nbsp; The 
	user must abandon any change to that artifact attribute by using the revert 
	command.&nbsp; Once the Artifact/Attribute has been reverted the Merge 
	Manager will be refreshed and the conflict will be removed. The
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/issue.gif" width="16" height="16">icon 
	indicates an informational conflict.&nbsp; The user does not have to take 
	any action to resolve these conflicts.&nbsp; It just provides the 
	information that the Source Branch deleted the Artifact/Attribute but the 
	Destination Branch has been modified.&nbsp; The user is free to act as 
	desired based on the provided information.</li>
	<li><b>The Artifact Name Column</b> - This column tells which artifact the 
	conflict occurred on.&nbsp; If the name is different between the Source and 
	Destination Branches, (this will show up as a conflict) it will at first 
	showing use the Source Branch value and then use whatever the name is 
	resolved to be after that has occurred.</li>
	<li><b>The Artifact Type Column</b> - Simply lists what type of Artifact is 
	conflicted</li>
	<li><b>The Conflicting Item Column</b> - In the case of an attribute 
	conflict it states what attribute type is conflicting.&nbsp; In the case of 
	an artifact conflict it will always say &quot;Artifact State&quot;</li>
	<li><b>The Source Value Column</b> - When possible this column tells what 
	value the Source Branch has for the conflict.&nbsp; It will always have a
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/green_s.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon. If the conflicting item is Word Formatted Content the words &quot;Stream 
	data&quot; will be shown.&nbsp; For artifact conflicts it will either show 
	&quot;Modified&quot; or &quot;Deleted&quot;.&nbsp; Left clicking on the
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/green_s.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon will populate the Merge Branch with value found on the Source Branch.</li>
	<li><b>The Destination Value Column</b> - When possible this column tells 
	what value the Destination Branch has for the conflict.&nbsp; It will always 
	have a
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/blue_d.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon. If the conflicting item is Word Formatted Content the words &quot;Stream 
	data&quot; will be shown.&nbsp; For artifact conflicts it will either show 
	&quot;Modified&quot; or &quot;Deleted&quot;.&nbsp; Left clicking on the
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/blue_d.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon will populate the Merge Branch with value found on the Destination 
	Branch.</li>
	<li><b>The Merge Value Column</b> - The Merged Value column serves to show 
	the user the value that has been selected for use when the Branch is 
	committed.&nbsp; The Merge value is actually kept on a new &quot;Merge Branch&quot; 
	and so any changes made to it will not affect the value seen on the Source 
	or Destination Branches.&nbsp; When the Merge Value column is blank with no 
	icon, the conflict is informational and no actions are provided.&nbsp; When 
	the Merge Value column contains a&nbsp;
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/conflict.gif" width="16" height="16">icon 
	the value has not been set.&nbsp; This is the icon you should see for all 
	conflicts (Except informational conflicts, or same value conflicts) the 
	first time you bring up the merge manager.&nbsp; The
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/green_s.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon indicates that the Source Value was selected as the final value.&nbsp; 
	The actual Source Value text will also be shown in this column if possible. 
	The
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/blue_d.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon indicates that the Destination Value was selected as the final value.&nbsp; 
	The Destination Value text will also be shown in this column if possible. 
	The
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/yellow_m.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon will be shown when a new value has been selected for the final value.&nbsp; 
	This indicates that the user has modified the final value so that it is no 
	longer a copy of the Source or Destination, but some variation thereof.&nbsp; 
	A
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/accept.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
	icon indicates that although both the Source Branch Value and Destination 
	Branch Value have changed they were both changed to the same value and so 
	there is not really a conflict. Left clicking on the icon in the Merge Value 
	column will bring up the Merge Wizard or in the case of un-resolvable 
	conflicts a dialog offering the ability to revert the conflicting item.</li>
	<li><b>The Right Click Menu</b> - Right clicking on any row will display a 
	menu with options for dealing with conflicts.&nbsp; Most of these options 
	are directed towards resolving Word Formatted Content conflicts as the other 
	conflicts are trivial.&nbsp; These options are explored below.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolution Of Conflicts</h2>
<p>Resolution of conflicts is provided in two different ways.&nbsp; The user may 
right click on the conflict row and bring up the conflict menu, and use that in 
combination with the
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/green_s.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
icon in the Source Value column and the
	<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/images/blue_d.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
icon in the Destination Value column. The other way is to bring up the Merge 
Wizard by left clicking on the icon that is in the Merge Value column. </p>
<p>There are entries on the context menu that are not shown on the wizard.&nbsp; 
These include &quot;Set Source as Default Branch&quot;, &quot;Set Destination as Default 
Branch&quot;, &quot;Reveal Artifact in Explorer&quot; and &quot;Resource History&quot;.&nbsp; These tools 
are intended to allow quick evaluation of the conflicts.&nbsp; The &quot;Set Source 
as Default Branch&quot; and &quot;Set Destination as Default Branch&quot; entries allow for the 
quick changing of the default branch between the Source and Destination 
Branches.&nbsp; The other two commands are used only when the Source or 
Destination Branch is selected as the default branch.&nbsp; If either the Source 
or Destination Branch is selected as the Default Branch it will be grayed out 
and will have a check mark next to it.&nbsp; The &quot;Reveal Artifact in Explorer&quot; 
will reveal the artifact in Explorer for the branch that is selected as the 
default branch.&nbsp; &quot;Resource History&quot; will likewise show the resource history 
for the Artifact on the branch that is selected as the default branch.</p>
